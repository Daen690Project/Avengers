Problem:
The challenge is to automate the process of tracking these time series, identifying those that demonstrate interesting patterns, and alerting human subject matter experts for closer examination and analysis. In other words, the FAA must reduce hundreds of thousands of monitored time series to a manageable quantity for humans at any given time. The goal of this project proposal is to create a number of such automation tools.

Objectives
In order to improve comprehension and results, need to improve the model. When assessing the numerous variables related to safety measures, one should take into consideration about the time series. The doable actions are to increase notifications, alerts and decrease plane incursions.
